# SQL Dojo - September 11, 2025 Session Notes

## What We Accomplished Today

### 1. Security Enhancements - Prompt Injection Protection
- **Added input sanitization** - `sanitize_user_query()` function removes dangerous patterns and limits query length
- **Implemented query validation** - `validate_sql_input()` detects injection attempts and validates basic SQL structure  
- **Updated validation prompts** - Restructured all exercise prompts with defensive format, clear boundaries, and security instructions
- **Added response parsing with fallback** - `parse_ai_response()` validates AI responses and provides fallbacks if compromised
- **Integrated security into /check-sql route** - Full security pipeline: validate ’ sanitize ’ process ’ parse

### 2. Rate Limiting Implementation  
- **Installed Flask-Limiter** - Added tiered rate limiting system
- **Implemented user tier detection** - Support for free vs paid users via API keys/cookies
- **Applied tiered limits**:
  - Free users: 5 queries/min, 30/hour, 100/day
  - Paid users: 15 queries/min, 200/hour, 1000/day
- **Added rate limit info API** - `/api/rate-limit-info` endpoint for users to check their limits
- **Custom error handling** - Informative 429 responses with retry timing

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- **Simplified exercise questions** - Removed Product Manager context from exercises 1-3, focused on SQL tasks only
- **Added celebratory emojis** - All correct answers now start with <‰ for better user feedback

## Current Status
- **Security**:  Complete with comprehensive prompt injection protection
- **Rate limiting**:  Complete with tiered user system  
- **Exercises**: 3/60 completed (Basic SELECT Operations 1-3)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Complete Basic SELECT Operations (Exercises 4-10)
Based on plan in `plan/0910-plan-beg-exercises.md`:

- **Exercise 4**: SELECT 4 columns from customer table
- **Exercise 5**: SELECT * from genre table  
- **Exercise 6**: SELECT * from media_type table
- **Exercise 7**: Column aliases
- **Exercise 8**: String concatenation
- **Exercise 9**: DISTINCT values from country
- **Exercise 10**: DISTINCT genre names

### Future Categories (Exercises 11-60)
1. Basic WHERE Filtering (11-25)
2. Logical Operators: AND, OR, NOT (26-35)  
3. BETWEEN and IN Operators (36-43)
4. LIKE Pattern Matching (44-50)
5. ORDER BY Sorting (51-60)

## Technical Notes
- All new exercises should use simplified question format (no Product Manager context)
- Security measures are now in place and don't need modification for new exercises
- Rate limiting is configured and ready for production use
- Exercise validation prompts follow defensive security pattern
