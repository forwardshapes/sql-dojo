Our objective is launch a web application that helps Product Managers practice writing SQL queries with practical exercises of varying difficulty. 

The vision is an application that will have 100+ realistic exercises and allowing for a user friendly way for a user to track their progress. We will provide some subset of exercises for free, and then charge a monthly plan for users who wish to access the locked content.

For every exercise, the user will be able to input their SQL query and submit it. Behind the scenes the application will send the SQL query to the Gemini LLM API in order to validate if the SQL syntax is valid for the exercise or not.
